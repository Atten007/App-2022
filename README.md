# App-2022
This repository is for my app tutorial on how to make an app in 2022.
## App Details
This app will be a very simple chat app named "mChat". The "m" stands for my real life name Mika and Chat means that my app is a very simple chat app.
### Notes
- Currently it's only an iOS/iPadOS 9.0 or newer App because I only have Apple devices in my home. An android app is currently in planning.
- It does currently only work on the newer iOS versions from 9.0 to 15.2 because Xcode (that's the application I'm currently writing my app in) does only support iOS 9.0 or newer
- At the fall of this year, the iPhone 4S, the iPad (2nd generation) and the iPad (3rd generation) won't be supported anymore because Xcode 14 (which will be coming this summer at the WWDC22 and will be available later this fall) will only have support for iOS 10.0 and newer.
- This is a YouTube tutorial in the language German because I come from Germany, but you can change the subtitle language on YouTube to English if you want.
