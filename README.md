# App-2022
This repository is for my app tutorial on how to make an app in 2022.
## App Details
This app will be a very simple chat app named "mChat". The "m" stands for my real life name Mika and Chat means that my app is a very simple chat app.
### Notes
- Currently it's only an iOS/iPadOS 12.0 or newer App because I only have Apple devices in my home. An android app is currently in planning.
- It does currently only work on the newer iOS versions from 12.0 to 15.2 because the current version of the Swift MessageKit is only available at iOS 12.0 or newer.
- This is a YouTube tutorial in the language German because I come from Germany, but you can change the subtitle language on YouTube to English if you want.
- This tutorial has been recorded with Xcode 13.2.1, a Mac that's running macOS Monterey 12.2, an iPhone that's running iOS 15.3 and an iPad that's running iPadOS 15.3
